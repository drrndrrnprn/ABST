It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .
Moderate prices .
Good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
Decor is charming .
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
– The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
Hats off to the chef .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .
There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .
This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
cirspy crust margherita pizza
The fries are yummy .
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat .
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
The wine list was superb , our tapas delightful , and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
Try the green curry ! ! !
We 've been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
They are the best bagels I 've had .
Caesar salad was superb .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
menu - uneventful , small .
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
Waitstaff are very friendly .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
I would highly recommend this place !
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
I definitely enjoyed the food as well .
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !
big thick pepperoni
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat ! ! !
The spicy mussels are a highlight .
Your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer SOHO location , and of course : Salmon , Tuna , Fluke , Yellow Tail , Cod , Mackeral , Jellyfish , Sea Urchin , Shrimp , Lobster , Sea Bream , Trout , Milk Fish , Blue Fin Tuna , Eel , Crab , Sardine , Monk Fish , Roe , Scallop , Oysters , and a varity of Toro .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
Good for a quick sushi lunch .
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN , THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DO N'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE .
I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beautiful .
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : BLUE RIBBON SUSHI .
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .
The setting is casual and romantic .
The menu is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
Super YUMMY Pizza !
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe .
the food is decent .
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricey .
Unique apppetizers .
Seattle 's BEST Winelist
Fish was overdone .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !
This place is a great stop for great food .
Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
Great vibe , lots of people .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
Best Neighborhood Standby .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in NY .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
- Mediocre Service / Quality
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
Drinks were good .
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .
Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
The chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .
Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented .
Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !
The ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .
Very good service and very good prices .
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout , BUT service terrible .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
The pizza itself is not exactly the best I 've had EVER , but still pretty good .
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
Ambiance -- relaxed and stylish .
I thought the food is n't cheap at all compared to Chinatown .
Paul , the maitre d ' , was totally professional and always on top of things .
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
Very romantic fires - I 've literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience .
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
You must try the shrimp appetizers .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
All their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .
Every course was better than the next .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impeccable , and the food magnificant .
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .
Everything was going good until we got our meals .
All-time favorites include the Big Mac , Chicken McNuggets , Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald 's famous french fries ; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available .
It has great sushi and even better service .
The food was almost always EXCELLENT .
The music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been subpar the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
Do n't waste money on decor .
This establishment is the real deal .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .
While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
The $ 72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
I liked the beer selection !
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
the food is delicious and highly recommended .
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food .
– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !
The food is very good and the service is great .
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .
best restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
The soup is pretty good too .
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
A++ The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake ! !
BTW , the service is very good .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .
great eats , good times .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
It 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what I go for .
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .
Great selection of sakes .
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
I have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
Food and service was okay .
The side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection ) .
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
It 's a small cute restaurant .
If you 're in the neighborhood , definitely stop by for a great meal .
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
Overall , the best bagel in town .
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
Great service , great food .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
The pickles were great addition .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
An excellent service
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
Mazing interior .
We always enjoy the pizza .
We ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats .
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet .
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
The counter service is bad .
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat .
The BEST Chinese food Uptown !
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
It 's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .
We are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes .
The appetizers are ok , but the service is slow .
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing .
The atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .
fine dining restaurant quality .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
We were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .
The service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .
I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
The Italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the UES ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .
The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces .
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
The drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .
The staff is very sharp and they look good too .
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
Awesome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel .
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A $ $ this is the place to be ! !
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !
They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the fish was very average .
Atmosphere was nice .
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I 've found little toninos .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
Great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home ( it reheats really well also ) .
The place is sleek , modern and playful and i will return again frequently .
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .
Great Hot Dogs !
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
The prices are not terrible .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
This place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
The lox is always fresh too .
i had a delicious shrimp creole .
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
The food is good .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
Great wine , great food .
Stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , cajun shrimp is good , not great .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ...
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
Poor customer service / poor pizza .
We were seated right away , the table was private and nice .
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
The food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .
Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , I believe is the traditional way ) !
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked perfect
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites ( but they raised the prices ) , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : No , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .
The service was courteous and attentive .
Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service .
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .
The bagels are fabulous .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee
Everything I 've had here is good , taco salads , burritos , enchiladas i love this place .
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one .
– By far the best bar in the east village ...
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
The waitress was not attentive at all .
The staff is courteous and friendly .
All are GREAT - poori , naan , paratha all FRESH .
Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
Great food but the service was dreadful !
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .
The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
The staff is excellent , special : that girl behind the bar , european chic .
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
The buffet had a nice selection .
The specials are usually quite good too .
The food however , is what one might expect .
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .
Just straight up cheap , good food .
even the wine by the glass was good .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .
Even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Two wasted steaks -- what a crime !
I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience .
Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .
The sandwhiches are out of this world !
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy .
If you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
i love this place !
If it is n't for the food ( A+++ ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .
– As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt ) .
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .
The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
Our waiter was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .
One of the best Sushi place in town .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
Delivery service is great too .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
it gets really busy , so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat , if you do have to wait , its not bad because the service is quick !
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .
The food was authentic .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .
Great staff .
And the bill was outrageous .
A nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .
The ' kamasutra ' and ' bombay cosmopolitan ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .
Service is great , takeout is good too .
The chicken dinner was real good .
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
The food is great ( big selection , reasonable prices ) and the drinks are really good .
All in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
The place is a lot of fun .
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
The food is great .
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
A wonderful place !
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
the food is always fresh ...
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven .
It has good music , nice tapas , an interesting selection of wines ( primarily Spanish ) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele .
All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
This place , however , has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above average .
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole .
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
The food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .
Drinks way over priced .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste .
Food is always fresh and hot ready to eat !
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
While it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb .
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall .
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic .
The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
Nothing on the menu is less than amazing .
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
Check out the secret back room .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
We were very impressed with the food and value .
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
Over price , and small portions .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
Huge portions , great and attentive service , and pretty good prices .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
The Management was less than accomodating .
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
Great sushi experience .
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
Love their drink menu .
Not the biggest portions but adequate .
Blue Ribbon lives up to it 's fantastic reputation .
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
They charge different prices all the time .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
Dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
Prices are very good .
Service was decent .
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
My daughter 's wedding reception at Water 's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
Try the Chef 's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
The service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
It 's traditional , simple italian food .
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
Service was also very good .
While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
if you 're looking for authentic hong kong-style food , look no further .
Great food with an awesome atmosphere !
It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .
Two words : Free wine .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Yum , the chicken is great here .
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .
NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
Thick fries , meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
