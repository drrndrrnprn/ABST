oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
Delicious crab cakes too .
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
The staff is 100 % Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
Food is great .
But the meals were terrible .
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager , but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up .
There restaurant is very casual , but perfect for lunch , and their delivery service is always very fast .
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .
Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .
Good creative rolls !
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .
The food was exceptional .
Great wine list , reasonably priced . -- Sara
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
The food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best I 've ever try .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .
Anyway , the owner was fake .
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
fresh restaurant was amazing ... ... .. food was delicious and of course fresh .
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
The lunch menu is an awesome deal !
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
Mediocre food
Great neighborhood joint .
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be .
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
Fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
The staff should be a bit more friendly .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
The dim sum here is only so-so .
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target .
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .
The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .
Always great service !
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
Really cool stauff inside .
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
Late night dinning with exeptional food .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
Good food at the right price , what more can you ask for .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy !
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
Nice ambience , but highly overrated place .
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe .
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
Quick and friendly service .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
This place has the best pizza .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n't eat it .
The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
THe Pizza and wine were excellent -- the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I 've never been dealt with rudely .
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
Best Sushi in town .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
The food was great !
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
Also , the chick peas with shrimp ( appetizer ) is divine .
The food was absolutely horrible !
This place is great .
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the food .
Dishes denoted as `` Roy 's Classics '' ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room ! ! !
the waitstaffs are nice though .
Our waiter was horrible ; so rude and disinterested .
I really liked this place .
The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns -- just outstanding .
Overall , not worth the money .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
This place is not worth the prices .
I recommend this place to everyone .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
I trust the people at Go Sushi , it never disappoints .
You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .
The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you 'll like it !
The staff offers impeccable service .
The food is simply unforgettable !
The coffe is very good , too .
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
The food was so-so .
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
Indoor ambience was modern .
It ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
service was efficient courteous .
And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
While the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had !
Very good wine choices .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
Acceptable prices .
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
I 'm in love with the lobster ravioli !
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
THe perfect spot .
It 's constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St. , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh ) .
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray 's , Sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the Outstanding Pizza !
black white shakes came out good also .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
The selection of food is excellent ( I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants ) , and the atmosphere is great .
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
The wait staff was very attentive and polite .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
I loved this place ! !
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area .
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant .
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
Best food , phenominal service
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .
The cuisine from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .
They have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well .
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .
The house special roll is really good .
This place is charming and relaxing .
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
– I will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht ... so good .
Poor service and management
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese !
– The pepperoni 's cut real thick -- Yum .
Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .
Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
several times and put up with the waiters ' bad manners , knowing that their job is n't easy .
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delicious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .
Fair menu selection .
Service not the friendliest to our `` large party '' !
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .
The specialty here is decadent pancakes , but I 've been back now four times , and I 've been wowed every time .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
the mushroom barley soup is amazing .
It 's a great place to people watch .
Fresh ingrediants and super tasty .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .
Love YUKA .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's ... ..
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... ..were not good .
Killer Sushi !
But the pizza is way to expensive .
The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
The sushi was awful !
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent .
Also have great margaritas !
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles were awesome !
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; salads -all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day ( they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot ) .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
good variety but nothing surprising .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ...
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! !
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing .
people are rude bit again it 's new york !
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice .
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !
I also recommend the garlic knots .
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
but their mac cheese was YUMMY !
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
The pizza ’ s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you ’ re ordering .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
good food good wine that 's it .
They have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time .
The service was outstanding .
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ... .
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC !
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience .
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
The sushi here is delicious !
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
I 'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .
Not worth the prices .
The food was all good but it was way too mild .
Always popular , always full , always a wait .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more .
Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .
Disappointing food , lousy service .
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .
The food was pretty traditional but it was hot and good with large portions .
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch -- I dont mind .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .
The staff is very good .
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .
Unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
The design of the space is good .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .
Food is great and inexpensive .
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them .
The food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .
The chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
Just stick with the small dishes !
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .
For the location , the prices are very reasonable .
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices ? !
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
The food is great , service is ok .
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City .
Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect ! ! ! !
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
I 've had better Japanese food at a mall food court .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
To be honest , I 've had better frozen pizza .
had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .
Prices are in line .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .
Service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
Wonderful menu , warm inviting ambiance , great service the FOOD keeps me coming back !
The place was quiet and delightful .
I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .
the service is prompt friendly .
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
Because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
The bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
perfect for a quick meal .
The sushi is amazing ! ! !
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
The design is very intimate and romantic .
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .
– Ray 's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
Still I would recommend this place .
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at .
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
Incredible food at a very agreeable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
very good breads as well .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the food I eat in restaurants .
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
Tasty Dog !
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu .
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .
great service .
Good food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
I look forward to eating here again
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n't tip more than 10 % .
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean .
The service is excellent and always informative without an air .
The food was outstanding and the service was tops .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( Anywhere ) .
Good , fast service .
the icing MADE this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
The foie gras was sweet and luscious .
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .
And , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .
The prices were fantastic .
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
The food was actually awful .
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
Try the Pizza Ensalata !
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
Their specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n't remember what we had .
The nicest waiters in town .
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
The staff is no nonsense .
We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the service was really good .
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches .
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
Very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
Not only do they have the best escargot in town , they always try to accomodate our toddler .
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing .
Best . Sushi . Ever .
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
Great pizza for lunch place .
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
The place is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !
Their twist on pizza is healthy , but full of flavor .
Very nice touch that very much fits the place .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
Priced at upper intermediate range .
– I highly recommend Mioposto .
More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo .
Their coffee is quite good too !
Food was good and cheap .
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then I would put Murphy 's at the top of the list .
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
– The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ) .
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto yum ! ) .
And the prices were way to high for what you get .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
Would n't recomend it for dinner !
The sangria 's - watered down .
I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy !
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
Always busy , but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
the atmosphere is great .
Great restaurant , and even greater food !
Fish is so very fresh .
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the Sliced steak entree .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
Service is usually pretty good .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
