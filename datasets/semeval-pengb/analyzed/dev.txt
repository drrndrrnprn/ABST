If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
Try the Pad Thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they 're all delicious .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
The place was quiet and delightful .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
I LOVE their Thai
In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) ! ! !
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
The food now is inconsistent .
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
The setting is casual and romantic .
The food is excellent !
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
Service is fast and friendly .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
You must try the shrimp appetizers .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
Great food , great prices , great service .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
The food was absolutely amazing ! !
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we 've ever had ! !
The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine ! !
The waiter was attentive .
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Fantastic place .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
What a great place !
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
I really liked this place .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .
Quick and friendly service .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
Good food .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
The food is great and they have a good selection of wines at reasonable prices .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
Best Reuben sandwich ever !
Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten .
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .
Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
Authentic Pakistani food .
People are always friendly .
Just straight up cheap , good food .
Faan is sooo good .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
The food was actually aweful .
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w/ chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
Staff is very accomodating .
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
even the wine by the glass was good .
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ... ..very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... ..all on Roosevelt Avenue !
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
The food is great .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate , location wise .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
I recommend this place to everyone .
Great food .
The pastas are incredible , the risottos ( particularly the sepia ) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .
The food here was mediocre at best .
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ... .
Tasty Dog !
Super YUMMY Pizza !
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
Great sake !
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .
Best . Sushi . Ever .
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .
Excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .
The waiter was attentive , the food was delicious and the views of the city were great .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
Excellent food for great prices
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .
my favorite place lol
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .
I love this place
The service was quick and friendly .
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
The potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .
Very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .
the food is always fresh ...
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
food was luke warm .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down
Favorite Sushi in NYC
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .
The Dancing , White River and Millenium rolls are musts .
Gross food – Wow-
And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .
The food was good , the place was clean and affordable .
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
The staff is very good .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
Nice view of river and NYC .
Great survice
Raymond the bartender rocks !
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .
The omlette for brunch is great ...
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ...
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .
Overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
The veal was incredible last night .
This place is a must visit !
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
My daughter 's wedding reception at Water 's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .
Everyone raved about the atmosphere ( elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views ) and the fabulous food !
Service was wonderful ;
Service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .
However , our main course was wonderful .
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
All in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .
Subtle food and service
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .
Servers are all different , Greg is my favorite .
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings ! ! !
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out ! ! ! !
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
Great place , great value .
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .
Good creative rolls !
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .
The appetizers are also delicious !
Amazing food .
Mazing interior .
Great food !
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being Indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .
I was speechless by the horrible food .
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ...
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ...
Patsy 's Pizza - true love
Hands down the best pizza on the planet .
great hot dogs .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .
Helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .
The only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .
great food
This place has great indian chinese food .
Be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .
Even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING , i 've had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in NYC .
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .
This establishment is the real deal .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
Look , the appetizers were really good .
The entree was also very good .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
Dessert : pure disaster .
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .
Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
The place is beautiful !
The hostess was very pleasant .
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .
Service not the friendliest to our `` large party '' !
Great Indian food
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .
Very `` normal Indian food '' , but done really well .
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .
If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !
Great Shabu Shabu
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
The food tasted very good .
The main entree was also very good .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .
Good Food
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
The atmosphere was great .
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )
Everything was going good until we got our meals .
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
cirspy crust margherita pizza
it was really good pizza .
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !
Great Hot Dogs !
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
Best meal in a long time !
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .
The food is great and the environment is even better .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
Great Atmosphere
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .
Poor service and management
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .
The food is very good , but not outstanding .
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .
bad staff
I generally like this place .
The food is good .
The design of the space is good .
But the service is HORRID !
Serves really good sushi .
Not the biggest portions but adequate .
Green Tea creme brulee is a must !
It has great sushi and even better service .
The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .
Good food !
This is a great place to get a delicious meal .
The staff is pretty friendly .
The onion rings are great !
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... ..were not good .
Nice ambience , but highly overrated place .
Worst Service I Ever Had
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .
Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .
I complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .
Fabulous Italian Food !
– I highly recommend Mioposto .
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .
I love this restaurant
– I will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .
The food was great !
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .
Caution - its real food for people who love the best .
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .
Rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .
Furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .
Freshest sushi – I love this restaurant .
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .
Their apps are all delicious .
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .
But the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .
– The food was not great & the waiters were rude .
great service
my service was stellar !
food was fine , with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa .
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .
Best Sushi in town .
The best calamari in Seattle !
– ... and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather .
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .
Endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !
– By far the best bar in the east village ...
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .
Definitely has one of the best jukebox 's i 've seen in a long long time .
The food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .
The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .
And the upstairs is a great place to hang out .
Not alot of smoking places left in New York , but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .
The sushi here is delicious !
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific .
I 've had the Jellyfish , Horse Mackerel , Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others , and they were all good .
The decor is rustic , traditional Japanese .
The service was courteous and attentive .
Mediocre food
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .
We are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .
Service was decent .
Drinks were good .
Excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .
Best Indian food in L.A .
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .
The chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .
It 's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .
Never too crowded and always great service .
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .
I appreciate their delivery too .
Nice food but no spice !
– I really enjoyed my meal here .
I had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .
The food was all good but it was way too mild .
The naan was some of the best I 've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .
Even the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good .
– I do n't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious .
I love the warm & cosy environment .
best restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager
i am never disappointed with there food .
the atmosphere is great .
great lunch spot
– Great financial district mexican spot .
Always busy , but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .
Everything I 've had here is good , taco salads , burritos , enchiladas i love this place .
Also have great margaritas !
The food is simply unforgettable !
The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .
Holy Hummus !
– The food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .
Dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .
The side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .
Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , I believe is the traditional way ) !
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .
However , this place is a gem , and I wo n't stop going back .
great beer
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .
The band was very good and the service was attentive .
We ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .
Seattle 's BEST Winelist
The sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .
The food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere ( including mainland Europe ) .
Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee
– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu .
The coffe is very good , too .
Great open and friendly ambience .
This place is charming and relaxing .
The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .
It 's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .
Great food , spectacular location , and friendly service keep us coming back year after year .
Enjoyed the food
Food was good and cheap .
I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it .
Atmosphere was nice .
Service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy .
Still I would recommend this place .
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW
Great food with an awesome atmosphere !
– Eggs , pancakes , potatoes , fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious .
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect ! ! ! !
plus , i am allergic to rice , and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- did n't even bat an eye !
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake ! !
Unbeatable sushi !
Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi , and very tasty rolls too .
Be sure to try the oyster roll .
– How to describe the best sushi in NYC : hmmmm , delicious , amazing , fantastic , suculent , perfect , nah , all of the above .
The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had .
Good Sushi , High Price
One of the best Sushi place in town .
The house special roll is really good .
– I ca n't believe Murphy 's has been around for over 25 years , amazing .
Brunch at Murphy 's is to die for , my specialty ... egg white omelet , the food is always freshly prepared .
It 's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous !
Save room for scrumptious desserts .
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n't forget !
– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district .
Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials .
Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated , the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .
The atmosphere was just okay .
Space was limited , but the food made up for it .
We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .
The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n't eat it .
Great food , better Margaritas !
– This is one of my top lunch spots , huge portions , fast service and amazing margaritas ! !
it gets really busy , so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat , if you do have to wait , its not bad because the service is quick !
Check out the art on the walls , very colorful !
i love this place !
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .
The lunch menu is an awesome deal !
plenty of food , trust me .
Fresh ingrediants and super tasty .
Best food , phenominal service
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer , the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .
Not only can the selection be innovative , but there 's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .
The nicest waiters in town .
– This place is unbelievably over-rated .
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then I would put Murphy 's at the top of the list .
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .
Your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer SOHO location , and of course : Salmon , Tuna , Fluke , Yellow Tail , Cod , Mackeral , Jellyfish , Sea Urchin , Shrimp , Lobster , Sea Bream , Trout , Milk Fish , Blue Fin Tuna , Eel , Crab , Sardine , Monk Fish , Roe , Scallop , Oysters , and a varity of Toro .
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : BLUE RIBBON SUSHI .
Hands down , the best tuna I have ever had .
Blue Ribbon lives up to it 's fantastic reputation .
Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting .
Try the Chef 's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .
Poor customer service / poor pizza .
– As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .
To be honest , I 've had better frozen pizza .
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .
The food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .
Seabass on lobster risotto was the best .
Caesar salad was superb .
Great bottle of wine .
The food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .
AVOID THE PLACE
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !
We left without ever getting service .
Best Crab Cakes in Town
Great seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .
Great Pizza , Poor Service
– Love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .
Also love their caeser salad .
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .
Great Breakfast
The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .
I love breakfast here .
Their crab eggs benedict is addicting .
All their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .
Chintzy portions
– The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ) .
Terrible service , food ok , pricey
Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .
As usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .
Their specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n't remember what we had .
Great selection of sakes .
It is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .
Very poor customer service .
– Schooner or Later 's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .
While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .
great service .
good sake selection .
– Ray 's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .
I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .
I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy !
And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .
Great Breakfast
– Great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , B Fast burritos , Gluten Free menu .
The service is fantastic at this fun place .
Best Neighborhood Standby .
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .
The music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .
Oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !
Good Food , Great Service , Average Prices ( For the Strip )
When I walked in , I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .
The music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .
I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .
It was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was OK .
I picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .
The steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .
It ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .
But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .
good sake , good food – i honestly do n't know much about japanese food at all .
Server made several sake suggestions which were very good .
had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .
The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .
Most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .
At best , the food was good and definately overpriced .
My favortie pizza joint in Seattle
The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .
I 've always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly .
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .
– My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café .
You won ’ t be disappointed by their menu .
The pizza ’ s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings .
Try the Pizza Ensalata !
The pizza ’ s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you ’ re ordering .
The food is sinful .
The staff was really friendly .
The atmosphere was great .
The specialty here is decadent pancakes , but I 've been back now four times , and I 've been wowed every time .
Nothing on the menu is less than amazing .
Good eats .
I have been to this place , folks and it is BAD .
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .
I have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .
– The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .
The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns -- just outstanding .
The service is really attentive and charming .
The service was excellent , the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .
– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .
The food is fantastic , authentic , delicious and very , very affordable .
The decor was beautiful and unique .
There was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .
Our server was very professional and friendly .
It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .
The sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !
If you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...
big thick pepperoni
– The pepperoni 's cut real thick -- Yum .
The pizza itself is not exactly the best I 've had EVER , but still pretty good .
Food was good and appetizing .
Portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .
Fair menu selection .
The appetizer was interesting , but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious .
Indoor ambience was modern .
It 's a great place to people watch .
Late night dinning with exeptional food .
We were seated right away , the table was private and nice .
The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .
The food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best I 've ever try .
The portions are big though , so do not order too much .
Groovy music made the dinner casual .
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .
– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !
The atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing ...
The catering is out of this world , and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !
Drinks are suberb , and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door .
- Mediocre Service / Quality
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .
Much more than just a great view !
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray 's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !
To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .
For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .
I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .
Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
Avoid this place !
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
I was very disappointed with this restaurant .
Food was okay , nothing great .
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
I/we will never go back to this place again .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat ! ! !
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
Food awesome .
Service friendly and attentive .
the food is decent .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
Food is great .
Service is top notch .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't .
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
This place is incredibly tiny .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
This place is great .
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
I 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
The drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .
Try their chef 's specials -- they are to die for .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
I had a great time at Jekyll and Hyde !
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
The food was good too .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
Great service , great food .
Two complaints -- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
fine dining restaurant quality .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
The chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
The staff is no nonsense .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
The bagel was huge .
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicious the food and the service was .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
All the staff is absolutely professional ! !
This restaurant was way overhyped .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
It 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
fresh restaurant was amazing ... ... .. food was delicious and of course fresh .
Hats off to the chef .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
Great vibe , lots of people .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
